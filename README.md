Antenna Control System

The Antenna Control System is a Kivy-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to manage and control antenna alignment. This system allows users to set and verify vertical and horizontal alignments of antennas, reset them to previously configured values, and generate a plot of antenna positions.
